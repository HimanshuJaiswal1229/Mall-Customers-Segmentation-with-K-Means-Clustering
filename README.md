# Mall-Customers-Segmentation-with-K-Means-Clustering
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment retail customers based on purchase behaviorâ€”primarily using metrics like annual income and spending score. The goal is to uncover meaningful segments (e.g., high-income high-spenders, low-income budget-conscious shoppers) that inform targeted marketing and business strategies.
